1. Window Functions
Great job! You now have experience transforming data using simple subqueries, correlated subqueries, and common table expressions.

2. Working with aggregate values
Let's tackle another limitation you've likely encountered in SQL -- the fact that you have to group results when using aggregate functions. If you try to retrieve additional information without grouping by every single non-aggregate value, your query will return an error. Thus, you can't compare aggregate values to non-aggregate data.

3. Introducing window functions!
You can work around this limitation using a window function. Window functions are a class of functions that perform calculations on a result set that has already been generated, also referred to as a "window". You can use window functions to perform aggregate calculations without having to group your data, just as you did with a subquery in SELECT. You can also use them to calculate information such as running totals, rankings, and moving averages.

4. What's a window function?
So what's a window function? How do you use it? Let's start with a query from chapter 2, where we answered the question, "how many goals were scored in each match in 2011/2012, and how did that compare to the average?" This query selects two columns from match table, and then used a subquery in SELECT to pass the overall average along the data set without aggregating the results.

5. What's a window function?
The same results can be generated using the clause common to all window functions -- the OVER clause. Instead of writing a subquery, calculate the AVG of home_goal and away_goal, and follow it with the OVER clause. This clause tells SQL to "pass this aggregate value over this existing result set." The results are identical to the previous statement that used a subquery in SELECT, with a simpler syntax and faster processing time.

6. Generate a RANK
Another simple type of column you can generate with a window function is a RANK. A RANK simply creates a column numbering your data set from highest to lowest, or lowest to highest, based on a column that you specify. Let's take the same query as the previous example, without the window function, and use it to answer the question -- what is the RANK of matches based on the number of goals scored?

7. Generate a RANK
We can answer this using the RANK window function. In order to set this up, let's add a new column in SELECT as you see here. To create the rank, you start with the RANK function, using parentheses, followed by the OVER clause. Inside the OVER clause, include the ORDER BY clause, and the column or columns you want to use to generate the rank. By default, the RANK function orders the results and ranking from smallest to largest values. In the case of our data set here, this isn't particularly informative.

8. Generate a RANK
You can easily correct this by adding the DESC function to reverse the order of the rank, just as you would if you were using ORDER BY at the end of your query. You'll notice that the RANK function automatically ties identical values, such as the first 2 results, and then skips the next value in the rank.

9. Key differences
There are a few key considerations when using window functions. First, window functions are processed after the entire query except the final ORDER BY statement. Thus, the window function uses the result set to calculate information, as opposed to using the database directly. Second, it's important to know that window functions are available in PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, but not in SQLite.

10. Let's practice!
Okay, let's practice some simple window functions using the OVER clause!

The match is OVER
The OVER() clause allows you to pass an aggregate function down a data set, similar to subqueries in SELECT. The OVER() clause offers significant benefits over subqueries in select -- namely, your queries will run faster, and the OVER() clause has a wide range of additional functions and clauses you can include with it that we will cover later on in this chapter.

In this exercise, you will revise some queries from previous chapters using the OVER() clause.

Instructions
100 XP
Select the match ID, country name, season, home, and away goals from the match and country tables.
Complete the query that calculates the average number of goals scored overall and then includes the aggregate value in each row using a window function.

SELECT 
	-- Select the id, country name, season, home, and away goals
	m.id, 
    c.name AS country, 
    m.season,
	m.home_goal,
	m.away_goal,
    -- Use a window to include the aggregate average in each row
	AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) OVER() AS overall_avg
FROM match AS m
LEFT JOIN country AS c ON m.country_id = c.id;

Good job! The basic window function with an OVER clause functions just like a subquery in SELECT.

What's OVER here?
Window functions allow you to create a RANK of information according to any variable you want to use to sort your data. When setting this up, you will need to specify what column/calculation you want to use to calculate your rank. This is done by including an ORDER BY clause inside the OVER() clause. Below is an example:

SELECT 
    id,
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY home_goal) AS rank
FROM match;
In this exercise, you will create a data set of ranked matches according to which leagues, on average, score the most goals in a match.

Instructions
100 XP
Select the league name and average total goals scored from league and match.
Complete the window function so it calculates the rank of average goals scored across all leagues in the database.
Order the rank by the average total of home and away goals scored.

SELECT 
	-- Select the league name and average goals scored
	l.name AS league,
    AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS avg_goals,
    -- Rank each league according to the average goals
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal)) AS league_rank
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m 
ON l.id = m.country_id
WHERE m.season = '2011/2012'
GROUP BY l.name
-- Order the query by the rank you created
ORDER BY league_rank;

Good job! You'll notice that the default order is from smallest to largest value -- in this case, the Polish league tends to have the fewest goals scored on average.

Flip OVER your results
In the last exercise, the rank generated in your query was organized from smallest to largest. By adding DESC to your window function, you can create a rank sorted from largest to smallest.

SELECT 
    id,
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY home_goal DESC) AS rank
FROM match;
Instructions
100 XP
Complete the same parts of the query as the previous exercise.
Complete the window function to rank each league from highest to lowest average goals scored.
Order the main query by the rank you just created.

SELECT 
	-- Select the league name and average goals scored
	l.name AS league,
    AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS avg_goals,
    -- Rank leagues in descending order by average goals
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) DESC) AS league_rank
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m 
ON l.id = m.country_id
WHERE m.season = '2011/2012'
GROUP BY l.name
-- Order the query by the rank you created
ORDER BY league_rank;

Great job! Unlike a subquery in SELECT, your window function will apply the filter that you include in your WHERE clause.


Got It!
1. Window Partitions
You've done a great job working with the OVER clause so far! The real bread and butter of window functions that differentiates them from subqueries in select, are in the functions you can add within the OVER clause.

2. OVER and PARTITION BY
One important statement you can add to your OVER clause is PARTITION BY. A partition allows you to calculate separate values for different categories established in a partition. This is one way to calculate different aggregate values within one column of data, and pass them down a data set, instead of having to calculate them in different columns. The syntax for a partition is fairly simple. Just like before, use an aggregate function to compute a calculation, such as the AVG of the home_goal column. You then add the OVER clause afterward, and inside the parentheses, state PARTITION BY, followed by the column you want to partition the average by. This will then return the overall average for, or PARTITIONed BY each season.

3. Partition your data
Let's take a look at how this works in a query. This is the example query from the previous lesson, answering the question, "How many goals were scored in each match, and how did that compare to the overall average?" This is accomplished using the OVER clause, and the query returns the date, goals scored, and overall average.

4. Partition your data
Let's expand on the previous question, and instead ask, "How many goals were scored in each match, and how did that compare to the season's average?" We can do this by adding a PARTITION BY clause to the OVER clause from the previous slide. Specifying, "PARTITION BY season" returns each season's average on each row, in accordance to the season that each record belongs to. As you can see, rows 1 and 2 are matches played in the 2011/2012 season, and the season_avg column contains the 2011/2012 season average. Rows 3 and 4 are part of the 2012/2013 season, and return the 2012/2013 season average.

5. PARTITION by Multiple Columns
You can also use PARTITION to calculate values broken out by multiple columns. In the query you see here, the OVER clause contains two columns to partition the AVG goals scored--season, and country. The result set returns the average goals scored broken out by season and country. In row 1, a match was played in Belgium in the 2011/2012 season, and had 1 goal scored throughout the match. This is compared to the 2.88, which is the average goals scored in Belgium in the 2011/2012 season.

6. PARTITION BY considerations
PARTITION BY is a pretty straight forward addition to the OVER clause. You can partition calculations by 1 or more columns as necessary to answer a question you may have. Additionally, you can use a PARTITION with any kind of window function -- calculation, rank, or others that we will discuss further in the following lesson.

7. Let's practice!
For now, let's practice calculating window partitions on our match data.

PARTITION BY a column
The PARTITION BY clause allows you to calculate separate "windows" based on columns you want to divide your results. For example, you can create a single column that calculates an overall average of goals scored for each season.

In this exercise, you will be creating a data set of games played by Legia Warszawa (Warsaw League), the top ranked team in Poland, and comparing their individual game performance to the overall average for that season.

Where do you see more outliers? Are they Legia Warszawa's home or away games?

Instructions
100 XP
Complete the two window functions that calculate the home and away goal averages. Partition the window functions by season to calculate separate averages for each season.
Filter the query to only include matches played by Legia Warszawa, id = 8673.

SELECT
	date,
	season,
	home_goal,
	away_goal,
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8673 THEN 'home' 
		 ELSE 'away' END AS warsaw_location,
    -- Calculate the average goals scored partitioned by season
    AVG(home_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season) AS season_homeavg,
    AVG(away_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season) AS season_awayavg
FROM match
-- Filter the data set for Legia Warszawa matches only
WHERE 
	hometeam_id = 8673
    OR awayteam_id = 8673
ORDER BY (home_goal + away_goal) DESC;

Good job! You've generated an ordered data set with window functions to compare each game's score to averages for that season.

PARTITION BY multiple columns
The PARTITION BY clause can be used to break out window averages by multiple data points (columns). You can even calculate the information you want to use to partition your data! For example, you can calculate average goals scored by season and by country, or by the calendar year (taken from the date column).

In this exercise, you will calculate the average number home and away goals scored Legia Warszawa, and their opponents, partitioned by the month in each season.

Instructions
100 XP
Construct two window functions partitioning the average of home and away goals by season and month.
Filter the dataset by Legia Warszawa's team ID (8673) so that the window calculation only includes matches involving them.

SELECT 
	date,
	season,
	home_goal,
	away_goal,
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8673 THEN 'home' 
         ELSE 'away' END AS warsaw_location,
	-- Calculate average goals partitioned by season and month
    AVG(home_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season, 
         	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)) AS season_mo_home,
    AVG(away_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season, 
            EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)) AS season_mo_away
FROM match
WHERE 
	hometeam_id = 8673
    OR awayteam_id = 8673
ORDER BY (home_goal + away_goal) DESC;

Excellent! You successfully partitioned your averages by each month in the season. In the next lesson, we'll expand on the usefulness of information generated with window functions.


Got It!
1. Sliding windows
In addition to calculating aggregate and rank information, window functions can also be used to calculate information that changes with each subsequent row in a data set.

2. Sliding windows
These types of window functions are called sliding windows. Sliding windows are functions that perform calculations relative to the current row of a data set. You can use sliding windows to calculate a wide variety of information that aggregates one row at a time down your data set -- running totals, sums, counts, and averages in any order you need. A sliding window calculation can also be partitioned by one or more columns, just like a non-sliding window.

3. Sliding window keywords
A sliding window function contains specific functions within the OVER clause to specify the data you want to use in your calculations. The general syntax looks like this -- you use the phrase ROWS BETWEEN to indicate that you plan on slicing information in your window function for each row in the data set, and then you specify the starting and finishing point of the calculation. For the start and finish in your ROWS BETWEEN statement, you can specify a number of keywords as shown here. PRECEDING and FOLLOWING are used to specify the number of rows before, or after, the current row that you want to include in a calculation. UNBOUNDED PRECEDING and UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING tell SQL that you want to include every row since the beginning, or the end, of the data set in your calculations. Finally, CURRENT ROW tells SQL that you want to stop your calculation at the current row.

4. Sliding window example
For example, the sliding window in this query includes several key pieces of information in its calculation. It first states that the goal is to calculate a sum of goals scored when Manchester City played as the home team during the 2011/2012 season. It then tells you that you want to turn this calculation into a running total, ordered by the date of the match from oldest to most recent and calculated from the beginning of the data set to the current row. Your resulting data set looks like this, with a column calculating the total number of goals scored across the season, with a final total listed in the last row.

5. Sliding window frame
Using the PRECEDING statement, you also have the ability to calculate sliding windows with a more limited frame. For example, the query you see here is similar to the previous one, with a slightly modified sliding window. The phrase UNBOUNDED PRECEDING is replaced here with the phrase 1 PRECEDING, which calculates the sum of Manchester City's goals in the current and previous match. As you see in the data set here, the two rows in red are used to calculate the sum on the second row, and the two rows in green are used to calculate the sum on the third row.

6. Let's practice!
There are a wide variety of sliding windows you can use to calculate information in your query. Let's practice here with some examples based on what we've reviewed so far.

Slide to the left
Sliding windows allow you to create running calculations between any two points in a window using functions such as PRECEDING, FOLLOWING, and CURRENT ROW. You can calculate running counts, sums, averages, and other aggregate functions between any two points you specify in the data set.

In this exercise, you will expand on the examples discussed in the video, calculating the running total of goals scored by the FC Utrecht when they were the home team during the 2011/2012 season. Do they score more goals at the end of the season as the home or away team?

Instructions
100 XP
Complete the window function by:
Assessing the running total of home goals scored by FC Utrecht.
Assessing the running average of home goals scored.
Ordering both the running average and running total by date.

SELECT 
	date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal,
    -- Create a running total and running average of home goals
    SUM(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date 
         ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total,
    AVG(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date 
         ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_avg
FROM match
WHERE 
	hometeam_id = 9908 
	AND season = '2011/2012';
	
Good job! Sliding windows allow for a wide variety of calculations with your database.

Slide to the right
Now let's see how FC Utrecht performs when they're the away team. You'll notice that the total for the season is at the bottom of the data set you queried. Depending on your results, this could be pretty long, and scrolling down is not very helpful.

In this exercise, you will slightly modify the query from the previous exercise by sorting the data set in reverse order and calculating a backward running total from the CURRENT ROW to the end of the data set (earliest record).

Instructions
100 XP
Complete the window function by:
Assessing the running total of home goals scored by FC Utrecht.
Assessing the running average of home goals scored.
Ordering both the running average and running total by date, descending.

SELECT 
	-- Select the date, home goal, and away goals
	date,
    home_goal,
    away_goal,
    -- Create a running total and running average of home goals
    SUM(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date DESC
         ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS running_total,
    AVG(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date DESC
         ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS running_avg
FROM match
WHERE 
	awayteam_id = 9908 
    AND season = '2011/2012';
    
Good job! You can reverse your calculations with your window functions to best suit your needs in an analysis.


Got It!
1. Bringing it all Together
Congratulations! You've made it to the final lesson of the course.

2. What you've learned so far
Throughout the course we've covered a wide variety of methods for transforming, manipulating, and calculating data to answer a wide variety of questions in SQL. Specifically, you've learned how to use CASE statements for categorizing, aggregating, and calculating information, and how to use simple subqueries in SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses. You also learned how to use nested and correlated subqueries, and common table expressions to extract, match, and organize large amounts of data in order to generate a final table. Finally, you learned how to use some of the many window functions available to you in SQL.

3. Let's do a case study!
Let's put several of these topics together to answer one question about your data set -- Who defeated Manchester United in the 2013/2014 season?

4. Steps to construct the query
In the following exercises, you will generate a data set that tackles one of the issues we've explored during this course -- namely, that it's difficult to retrieve the names of teams who played in a given match. Since this isn't feasible with joins, we will accomplish it with common table expressions. We'll also be using CASE statements to categorize the outcomes of matches based on whether or not Manchester United won a particular match. Finally, we'll be ranking matches by the number of goals they lost the match using a window function.

5. Getting the database for yourself
If Manchester United happens to be a team that you favor, or if there are other European teams you consider a rival to your favorite team, I encourage you to explore the European Soccer Database for yourself and create similar, or completely different queries to answer your questions.

6. Let's practice!
Okay! Let's get to it!

Setting up the home team CTE
In this course, we've covered ways in which you can use CASE statements, subqueries, common table expressions, and window functions in your queries to structure a data set that best meets your needs. For this exercise, you will be using all of these concepts to generate a list of matches in which Manchester United was defeated during the 2014/2015 English Premier League season.

Your first task is to create the first query that filters for matches where Manchester United played as the home team. This will become a common table expression in a later exercise.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a CASE statement that identifies each match as a win, lose, or tie for Manchester United.
Fill out the logical operators for each WHEN clause in the CASE statement (equals, greater than, less than).
Join the tables on home team ID from match, and team_api_id from team.
Filter the query to only include games from the 2014/2015 season where Manchester United was the home team.

SELECT 
	m.id, 
    t.team_long_name,
    -- Identify matches as home/away wins or ties
	CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'MU Win'
		WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'MU Loss'
        ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
FROM match AS m
-- Left join team on the home team ID and team API id
LEFT JOIN team AS t 
ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id
WHERE 
	-- Filter for 2014/2015 and Manchester United as the home team
	m.season = '2014/2015'
	AND t.team_long_name = 'Manchester United';
